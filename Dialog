A: A very good day sir. I am a software architect of Waterland Inventory Management System

S: I am fine. Thank you sir. Any problem? 

A: Sir, may I know what do you think about the current system? Are there any limitations or improvements
that can be done? For example, the system performance, security, or any constraints that we must comply to? 

S: In terms of performance, the current system are not able to perform well. Thus, I am hopping that the new system could be able to 
provides the users with better performance; for example, when they are using the system to store the inventory or search for the desired 
inventory, if possible, I wish it could take less times to perform the task. 

A:  Alright sir. Is there any other requirement? 

S: Oh yeah, besides performance, if possible, I would like the system be more asthetic and user-friendly. The current system are 
looking really bad, for the interfaces seem confusing sometimes. 

A: Oh. Noted Sir. So, sir means to you wish to improve the usability of the system, right? 

S: Yeah! That's what I mean. Besides, if possible, I do really wish that the users able to learn all the features of the system 
without any doubt; for example, they should be able to familiar with all the features of the system within 10 minutes. 

A: Alright, Sir. May I ask that any constraints on the budget? 

S: Hmm...Actually... we don't have sufficient budget on purchasing the expensive technologies. 

A: It's okay, Sir. I will take that into consideration. We will spend as minimum as possible to develop the system. No worry!

B: Cool. Thank you so much then. Any other question? 

A: So far, no question already. I will contact you if I meet any problems. Thank you so much for your precious times.
